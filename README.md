# KingOnTheMars Tap Bot

A tap-to-earn Telegram bot integrated with the TON blockchain.

## Project Description

KingOnTheMars Tap Bot is a Telegram bot that allows users to earn TON tokens by tapping. Users can set their TON wallet address and earn tokens based on their tapping activity. The bot periodically distributes rewards to the users' TON addresses.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/king_on_the_mars_tap_bot.git
    cd king_on_the_mars_tap_bot
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up the database:
    ```bash
    python -c "from database import create_db; create_db()"
    ```

5. Update `config.py` with your Telegram bot token and TON API key:
    ```python
    TELEGRAM_TOKEN = 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN'
    TON_API_KEY = 'YOUR_TON_API_KEY'
    ```

6. Run the bot:
    ```bash
    python bot.py
    ```

7. Schedule the reward distribution:
    - Create a cron job to run `reward_scheduler.py` at regular intervals.
